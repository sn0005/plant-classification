# plant-classification
Maple Leaves Ltd is a start-up company which makes herbs from different types of plants and its leaves. Currently the system they use to classify the trees which they import in a batch is quite manual. A labourer from his experience decides the leaf type and subtype of plant family. They have asked us to automate this process and remove any manual intervention from this process.


Objective: To classify the plant leaves by various classifiers from different metrics of the leaves and to choose the best classifier for future reference.


Implementation:
1) Load dataset (train and test csv). 
2) Import the required classification libraries along with pandas, numpy, seaborn etc
3) Import the classifiers (Randomforest, SVM, NaiveBayes, DecisionTrees)
4) Create a function to encode the labels of the strings given in the dataset
5) Split train set into training and testing set. The test set imported is for testing the best classifier accuracy once we choose it
6) Perform train_test_split with 80:20 ratio
7) Now X train, X test, Y train, Y test are ready.
8) We currently donâ€™t know which is the best classifier on the dateset. So, we apply all 4 of them.
9) Create the classifiers class and initialize all the respective classifiers.
10) Then run the X train & X test datasets through classifiers calculating the log loss and accuracy of the result
11) Choose the classifier which has the best accuracy
12) Then try to predict the result on the import test.csv dataset.
